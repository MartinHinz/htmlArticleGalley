# htmlArticleGalleyJNA

This is a fork of the htmlArticleGalley part of the [pkp/ojs](https://github.com/pkp/ojs), where I customize its behaviour for the needs of our online journal ['Journal of Neolithic Archaeology'](http://www.j-n-a.org).

@pkp thank you for your work! Because I just needed the subtree, this is not a regular fork. If you know how I can set this up, feel free to contact me!
